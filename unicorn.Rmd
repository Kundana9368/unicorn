In business, a unicorn is a startup company valued at over US$1 billion which is privately owned and not listed on a share market. This dataset consists of unicorn companies and startups across the globe as of November 2021, including country of origin, sector, select investors, and valuation of each unicorn.

### Scenario
You have been hired as a data analyst for a global venture capital firm that specializes in investing in high-potential start-ups. Your manager is interested in understanding the current landscape of unicorn companies to identify emerging trends and investment opportunities.

Using the unicorn dataset provided, your task is to analyze various factors such as the geographical distribution of unicorns, industry sectors with the highest valuations, funding patterns, and key investors. Your goal is to provide insights that can guide the firmâ€™s investment strategy, highlighting regions and industries with the most growth potential and identifying key investors who frequently back successful unicorns. This analysis will help the firm make data-driven decisions on where to allocate their resources for maximum return on investment.


### Purpose of the Project
To provide valuable insights into the dynamic landscape of unicorn companies for a global venture capital firm. The goal is to identify emerging trends, investment opportunities, and key factors contributing to the success of these companies. By analyzing the geography, industry, funding patterns, and key investors, the aim is to guide the firm's investment strategy and optimize resource allocation for maximum returns. The insights will be presented through an interactive dashboard, showcasing the distribution and characteristics of unicorn companies worldwide.

#### About the data set
* Data set contains records of 1074 Unicorn Companies from 47 different countries

### Exploratory Analysis
#### 1. Sector-wise Distribution of Unicorn Companies
```{r}
# Calculate the count of unicorn startups by sector
sector_counts <- table(companies_df$Industry)

# Create a data frame for plotting with sector counts
plot_data <- data.frame(Industry = names(sector_counts),
                        count = as.numeric(sector_counts))

# Create a bar chart showing unicorn startups by sector in descending order with data labels
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = reorder(Industry, -count), y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  geom_text(aes(label = count), vjust = 1.3, color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Industry", y = "Count") +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(),  # Remove background
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),  # Remove major gridlines
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),  # Remove minor gridlines
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Adjust x-axis text
```

# Reorder the Continent factor levels based on total companies count
continent_counts$Continent <- factor(continent_counts$Continent, levels = continent_counts$Continent)

# Create a bar chart showing total companies by continent in descending order
ggplot(continent_counts, aes(x = Continent, y = total_companies, fill = Continent)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +

### Investor Analysis
#### 1. Average Valuation of Unicorn Companies by Number of Investors
```{r}
avg_valuation_vs_investors <- companies_df %>%
  mutate(count_investors = str_count(Investors, "\\,") + 1) %>%  # Count number of investors
  group_by(count_investors) %>%
  summarise(average_valuation = mean(`Valuation...B.`, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Create a bar chart to show average valuation by number of investors
ggplot(avg_valuation_vs_investors, aes(x = factor(count_investors), y = average_valuation)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Number of Investors") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Average Valuation ($B)", labels = scales::comma) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```
* Companies with 4 investors showed the highest average valuation, indicating a strong correlation between the number of investors and high company valuations.
* Following closely, companies with 3 investors displayed the second-highest average valuation, suggesting a notable impact on valuation even with slightly fewer investors.
* Surprisingly, companies with only 1 investor ranked third in average valuation. This suggests that individual investors can significantly influence a companyâ€™s valuation under certain conditions.
* Companies with 2 investors had the lowest average valuation among the groups analyzed, highlighting the need for further investigation into potential factors influencing their lower valuations.

#### 2. Average correlation between Number of Investors and Average Valuation
```{r}
avg_valuation_vs_investors <- companies_df %>%
  mutate(count_investors = str_count(Investors, "\\,") + 1) %>%  # Count number of investors
  group_by(count_investors) %>%
  summarise(average_valuation = mean(`Valuation...B.`, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Calculate correlation between number of investors and average valuation
correlation <- cor(avg_valuation_vs_investors$count_investors, avg_valuation_vs_investors$average_valuation)
cat(correlation, "\n")
```
#### 3. Top 5 Investors and the number of companies they have invested in
```{r}
# Trim whitespace around Investors column
companies_df$Investors <- stringr::str_trim(companies_df$Investors)

# Count the number of companies each investor group is funding
investors_summary <- companies_df %>%
  separate_rows(Investors, sep = ",\\s*") %>%  # Separate multiple investors into rows
  mutate(Investors = stringr::str_trim(Investors)) %>%
  group_by(Investors) %>%
  summarise(total_companies = n_distinct(Company)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_companies)) %>%
  head(5)
print(investors_summary)
```
#### 4. Further analysis can be conducted to understand the nature of investments each investor. Analyzing Accel.
```{r}
accel_investments <- companies_df %>%
  filter(grepl("Accel", Investors, ignore.case = TRUE))

# Summarize the number of companies Accel has invested in each industry
accel_industry_summary <- accel_investments %>%
  group_by(Industry) %>%
  summarise(total_companies = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_companies))
print(accel_industry_summary)
```
